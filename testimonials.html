  <h2>Testimonials</h2>

  <blockquote>
    “The only downside to this training is not having it for an entire year! The training is useful because right after each session you can return to your class to immediately implement the strategies you learned during the session. These strategies allowed me to not only create but maintain a learning environment that was conducive to successful instruction.”

  <blockquote>
    “Week by week they take you through the process of building and implementing an already proven method for students to gravitate to. The positive reinforcement and the focus on being consistent helped me in having a very different school year this year. I use many of the materials from the course still. I often go back to the binder we used to see what else I can be doing to continue the success. Any teacher new or older that needs some fresh ideas on classroom management needs to take this course. The instructors are also such a vibe!”

  <blockquote>
    “I want to thank you for your help in providing me with a very effective classroom management strategy for responding to students' behavior issues. You helped me to identify the relevant rules and expectations that makes my class function properly, and then you tailored a behavior consequence plan that involved stages of disciplinary actions to take. This made the challenge of deciding the appropriate actions much simpler and consistent for all students.”
