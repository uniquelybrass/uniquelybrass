  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>While working together at a middle school, we witnessed firsthand the critical need for clear, consistent classroom management strategies. In response to the challenges faced by both teachers and struggling learners, we developed a structured system of rules and procedures that significantly increase instructional time. These strategies remove the guesswork from handling discipline issues by providing clear expectations for both students and teachers. As a result, classrooms have become less stressful, allowing educators to focus on teaching.</p>
  <p>Recognizing the growing number of teachers leaving the profession, we knew it was essential to present these tools in a concise, practical way. That mission led to the creation of Uniquely BRASS Consulting—a partnership designed to reinvigorate teachers' careers and provide consistent, effective classroom practices that maximize student learning.</p>

    <p>I bring 17 years of experience in education both as a secondary math teacher and as an adult education teacher. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with a diverse range of students, from those facing academic or behavioral challenges to high-performing honors students. These experiences have sharpened my ability to differentiate instruction effectively to meet the unique needs of all learners. This includes addressing the requirements of IEPs and, more importantly, doing what’s right for each student. In addition to my classroom work, I’ve had the privilege of serving as a math coach, supporting and guiding fellow educators. This role has deepened my passion for helping teachers create positive, structured learning environments that foster student engagement and success.</p>

    <p>I began my journey in education over 20 years ago, spending 14 of those years teaching English Language Arts. In 2019, I transitioned out of the classroom to take on new challenges, serving as a Testing Coordinator and Dean in Training for four years. Currently, I hold the position of Assistant Principal of Discipline. This role has allowed me to work closely with teachers, and through this experience, I’ve witnessed firsthand how the lack of clear rules, procedures, and routines can hinder classroom success. This insight has fueled my passion for supporting educators in creating structured, effective learning environments where both teachers and students can thrive.</p>
